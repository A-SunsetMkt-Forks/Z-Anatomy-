- It is not a fork because, tried but, incompatible with lfs to provide big lfs .blend files see [#5](/../../issues/5)

- Contributors, please, conform to https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ for better automatic contribution (commit without sudo to success)
- .blend original source : https://github.com/LluisV/Z-Anatomy/tree/PC-Version?tab=readme-ov-file lbl654225

- lbl654225 source seems to have been modified (no Startup.blend anymore + only bones are provided -> retrieval ancient downloaded source Startup.blend) -> be careful with any modification. From now, the reference file is  Startup.blend :  sha256sum  9de642d94eb00ffe19c2f1e1ae27f2042269951d86e6689a7eb925369b32a86d  of size 304.8 Mo, tested compatible with Blender 3D v3.6

- Pages fails to provide Startup.blend -> will be available by Google Drive [#173](/../../issues/173) (cf main website
https://moueza.github.io/Z-Anatomy/ )

- News : https://www.z-anatomy.com/ : incomplete ( regression ) : only bones
